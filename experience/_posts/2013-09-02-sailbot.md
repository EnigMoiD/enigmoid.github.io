As a coordinator, I made sure that everyone on my subteam had the knowledge and resources they needed to do their jobs.

The Olin Robotic Sailing team is a student-run and faculty-advised build team at Olin College. We design and build autonomous+R/C sailboats, and until recently have focused our attention on the [International Robotic Sailing Regatta](http://sailbot.org). The team is now moving more towards research with the long-term goal of sending an autonomous robotic sailboat across the Atlantic Ocean.
