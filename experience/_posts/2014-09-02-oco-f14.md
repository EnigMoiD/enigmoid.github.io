### As navigators, [Jacob Kingery](http://jacobkingery.github.io) and I schedule weekly rehearsals, hear auditions, organize concerts, and handle general logistics for the Olin Conductorless Orchestra.

The orchestra is largely self-run. We all choose our own pieces, direct our own rehearsals, and (as the name would suggest) conduct each other as we play.
