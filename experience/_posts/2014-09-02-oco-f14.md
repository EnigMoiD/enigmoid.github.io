### As navigators, [Jacob Kingery](http://jacobkingery.github.io) and I schedule weekly rehearsals, hear auditions, organize concerts, and handle general logistics for the Olin Conductorless Orchestra (OCO).

The orchestra is largely self-run. We all choose our own pieces, direct our own rehearsals, and (as the name would suggest) conduct each other as we play.

I've played Violin and currently play Viola in the orchestra. Over the last few seasons, we've played the pieces below.
