## Requirements

We set our own design goals, but the project had some basic requirements.

The hopper

- must have a trigger mechanism that delays the release of stored energy.
- can store no more than three Joules of energy.
- has a minimum mass and size.



## The Froghopper and Evolution

Froghoppers have an interesting way of jumping that took me a few iterations to really figure out and imitate. Each jumping leg of the froghopper has a large tendon on the short side of a pivot. The froghopper "cocks" a jumping leg by engaging a depression in the leg with a nub protruding from the body. 

The froghopper had a joint system and trigger for me to emulate. In the end I only imitated the joint and tendon system, as the froghopper's trigger seemed to be based on more than just a time delay. This was really all I could do without the ability to interact with the hopper after setting it.
