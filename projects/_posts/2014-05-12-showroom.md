"We designed a tool for car restorers that lets them share the story of their cars in a compelling way.",
"For this design class, teams worked with groups of real people to design products based on their needs, values, lifestyle, and a myriad of other factors. We worked with car restorers, and we noticed that before too long, they would take out their phones and start showing us pictures of the cars they had worked on. But the pictures were poorly shot, were out of order, and didn't do what the guys wanted them to. Had we not been invested in this group of people, their presentations would have been boring. So we designed a camera system that automatically documented the work they did in their shop, along with a system to present the progress of their car in a short, engaging vignette."
