"We designed a tool for car restorers that lets them share the story of their cars in a compelling way.",
"For this design class, teams worked with groups of real people to design products based on their needs, values, lifestyle, and a myriad of other factors. We worked with car restorers, and we noticed that before too long, they would take out their phones and start showing us pictures of the cars they had worked on. But the pictures were poorly shot, were out of order, and didn't do what the guys wanted them to. We knew that with a better way to tell their story, they'd really be able to capture their audience. So we designed a camera system that automatically documented the work they did in their shop, along with a system to present the story of their cars in a short, engaging vignette."
