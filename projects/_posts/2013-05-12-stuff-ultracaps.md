header: ["We researched graphene ultracapacitors and tried to make our own graphene.","We also compared graphene ultracapacitors to different forms of energy storage, and tried to imagine a future powered by small, light, instantly-charging batteries. We also looked at current-technology supercapacitors with an SEM to see how they deteriorated over a lifetime of use."]
