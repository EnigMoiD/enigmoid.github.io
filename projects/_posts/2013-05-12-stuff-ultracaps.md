header: ["We researched graphene ultracapacitors and tried to make our own graphene, following procedures from papers.","We also compared graphene ultracapacitors to different forms of energy storage, and tried to imagine a future powered by small, light, instantly-charged batteries. We also looked at current-technology supercapacitors with an SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) to see how they deteriorated over an artificially accelerated lifetime of use. Graphene is a fascinating material -- a single sheet of carbon atoms -- with incredible material properties and promises of many breakthrough applications. The potential for configurations of graphene with very high specific surface areas makes it a promising material for capacitors. The problem, as we experienced firsthand, is that graphene is very difficult to make."]
