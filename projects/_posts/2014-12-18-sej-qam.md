header: ["We did wireless data transmission the hard way.", "We wanted to learn about quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for our analog and digital communications class final project. To that end, we wrote MATLAB code to send images between USRPs. On the transmit end, we encoded the image into binary and packetized for sending. On the receive end, we performed open-loop timing correction and reassembled the image from the packets."]
