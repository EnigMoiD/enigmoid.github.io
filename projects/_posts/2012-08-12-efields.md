"I wrote an electric field simulator for iOS -- the free app has been downloaded thousands of times.",
"This was one of my first programming projects, and through it I explored C++ and OpenGL ES for the first time. Within the constraints of my limited experience, I tuned the code and shaders to make the app intuitive, fluid, and beautiful."
