header: ["We designed and laid out a mixed analog/digital integrated circuit. And we put our faces on an IC die!", "The circuit integrates an op-amp and what's essentially a digital (SPI) potentiometer to change the gain. It will be fabricated with the MOSIS 300nm process on a 1mm square die and packaged in a 40 pin ceramic DIP."]
