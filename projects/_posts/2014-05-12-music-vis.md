"We wrote a program that analyzes and visualizes a (very short segment of a) song.",
'Music visualizers break a song into small "windows" in time, and process that data to generate a series of images that line up with the music. Our visualizer encoded the intensity of frequency bands (left to right, low to high) in the height and color of the vertical bars, and the background color pulsed with the beat of the song. Perhaps surprisingly, the frequency spectrum was straightforward, but the beat finding took a lot more thought and time (both in implementation and execution). Read our [last-minute report](/doc/music-vis/paper.pdf) or watch our [hilarious video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ39KpvKcCA) to learn more.'
