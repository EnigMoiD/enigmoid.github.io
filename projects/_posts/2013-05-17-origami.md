header: ["For Olin's inaugural build day, I organized an open Origami folding party.", "Almost all the participants stopped by to fold a few modules, which we assembled into many polyhedra of varying size and complexity. Build day is about strengthening the Olin community and improving Olin, and seeing as some of these sculptures were installed around campus, I think it upheld both principles."]
