header: ['We designed built an Arduino-controlled petri dish scanner and controlled it with a Node API.',"It had a simple mechanical design that made it reliable and easy to control: a Servo with a light sensor turned to face the requested petri dish, and a light underneath allowed the system to determine the opacity of the dish's contents. The Node API started as an excuse to make a frontend with HTML/CSS instead of Python, but it turned into a full-on controller when I found a package that let Node talk to serial ports."]
