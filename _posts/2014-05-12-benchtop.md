header: ['We designed a high-efficiency 90W benchtop power supply with modern AC-DC and DC-DC conversion techniques.', "Unfortunately, the building part hasn't happened yet. We thought it would be nice to end up with something on our desks that could power our other projects, and designing a benchtop power supply (modeled after an ATX power supply) turned out to be a formidable task."]
