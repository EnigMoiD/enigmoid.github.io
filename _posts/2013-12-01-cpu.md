title: A Working CPU From Scratch
short: cpu

banner-position: .3

team: 4
specs: [[code, 'Verilog, MIPS Assembly']]

header: [We built a CPU with Verilog and ran MIPS Assembly on it., 'All of us were kind of baffled by this assignment at the start. Write a functioning CPU? We had barely finished writing a five-function ALU! It seemed like a daunting task at the time (and it turned out to be one), but we were successful.']

## Verilog: the language we love to hate
How does one "write" a Central Processing Unit, you may ask? Why, in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog, of course!

Languages like Verilog allow a computer architect to specify logic gates and their connections at the lowest level, like this:

{% highlight verilog linenos %}
not n0 (notSelect, select);
and aA (outA, inA, notSelect);
and aB (outB, inB, select);

or out (out, outA, outB);
{% endhighlight %}

Or to use language that describes the desired _behavior_ of a circuit rather than its specific structure, like this:
{% highlight verilog linenos %}
if (select)
    out <= inB;
else
    out <= inA;
{% endhighlight %}
Both of these snippets have identical behavior: `select` assigns either `inA` or `inB` to `out`. We could put either into a module, the Verilog functional unit, like this:
{% highlight verilog linenos %}
module Mux2x1 (output out, input inA, inB, select);
    always @(select, inA, inB) begin
        if (select)
            out <= inB;
        else
            out <= inA;
    end
endmodule
{% endhighlight %}
You probably noticed that we had to add a little something extra for the "behavioral" code to actually run. The "always" structure specifies a list of dependencies `@(like, these)` for the code block it contains â€“ whenever any of those variables change, the simulator reruns the block of code. In this case, we want the output to change whenever any of the inputs change, so we could have written `always @(*)` instead.

Verilog is different from languages that it seems similar to (like C) in a few important ways, which can make it frustrating for beginners (like us):

1. It is primarily parallel and asynchronous: The `<=` operator is for non-blocking, or asynchronous assignment; where `=` is for blocking, or C-style assignment. If things need to happen in a certain order, `=` should be used, but when writing Verilog it's generally better to come up with a solution that doesn't require that things happen in a certain order, since asynchronous logic is easier to translate into hardware.

1. Arrays are backwards and weird:
    - Array: `reg [31:0] array;`
    - 2D Array: `reg [31:0] matrix [0:31];`

1. There are two data types with fundamentally different behavior and methods of assignment:
    - `reg` is stateholding
    - `wire` is not stateholding

1. Syntax is weird: inputs and outputs must be explicitly labeled as such (because the syntax can't do that on its own), and `module ... (...);` has a semicolon, but `endmodule` doesn't! Plus all the `if (...) begin ... end else begin` stuff can get wordy fast.
