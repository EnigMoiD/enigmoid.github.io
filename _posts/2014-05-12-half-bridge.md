header: ['For our Circuits final project, we wanted to build a circuit that engineers still make out of transistors.', "Modern integrated circuits provide complex systems with thousands of transistors on individual dies. Today, it's really only economical for an engineer to build a circuit from scratch when it needs to handle power. We chose the half bridge because it's a subcircuit present in almost every high power, high efficiency siwtching circuit. It also allowed us to answer a question we found interesting: how do we get a voltage higher than the supply rails?"]
