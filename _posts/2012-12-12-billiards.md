header: ["We modeled the physics of billiards to find the ideal power and angle for a break.", "Pool, one of our favorite ways to spend time between lunch and class, seemed like a perfect subject for our final Modeling and Simulation class project. We learned a lot about physics, the game of billiards, and the things MATLAB was and was not meant to do. I also wrote an iPhone version because at a certain point, I needed a break from MATLAB."]
