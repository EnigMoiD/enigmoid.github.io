header: [The assignment was to create a LIDAR two servos and an Infrared range finder, "They weren't the ideal components (and the governing principle behind our system was nothing like the one behind a real LIDAR), but we were able to generate some pretty convincing 3-dimensional scans. And each scan only took a few minutes!"]

The sensor sends out and receives infrared light, and the attenuation of the light is more or less proportional to the distance the light has traveled. But it's not exact, and it's certainly not linear. So we needed to create a function to map the sensor voltage to its distance from the surface it's facing. The easiest way to do that was to take data at known distances to see what the sensor's response was.

We used MATLAB to generate a fourth order curve fit, and used the inverse of that function to convert sensor voltage to centimeters. These were the calibrated readings:
